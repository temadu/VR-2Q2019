How to use a model

The model is modular it cosist of many patterns, everything is snapping by vertices, so here you have
wall
wall_window
wall_gates

The objects above is a main structure you can clone them as you wish to get that kind of result you need, at the end you can 
manually add some side columns if you wish to.
Next we have floor it very simple, just clone to cover all the square of walls
Then we have :frame beams and columns: clone them together as it is in my template model.
Then wall_roof_pt1-4 clone then together to fill roof walls
So its almost the end, so here is final steps 
first of all when main shape is ready you need to lose holes at the outer corners use "closing_column"
and for the end clone the roof. It consist of 3 patterns 
roof_leftEnd
roof***
roof_rightEnd

Yes, thats right first should be roof_leftEnd or roof_rightEnd it depends on from which side you start to cover the roof 
and between them two you should cover the area with roof***

Thats all, if something wasn`t clear for you see my model template. 

Hope you enjoy)
